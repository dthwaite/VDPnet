### Volunteer Distributed Processing network - VDPnet

This is an experimental project that distributes compute intensive jobs to devices that have volunteered to run such jobs.

It is all browser based and the jobs run in Web Workers from the volunteer's browser.

Volunteering your device to do work is easy. Go to my [VDPnet](http://vdpnet.cloud) site and you'll see.

This site not only allows you to volunteer your device to process jobs for other people. It also provides instructions on how to define and submit your own jobs.

My VDP network is an experimental working prototype which I first published on 28-April-2016. I doubt anyone's volunteering!

There are, of course, rather more established and sophisticated volunteer processing systems. This one simply exhibits the bare essentials of such a system and does so exclusively in the context of browsers and `javascript`, thus making it very easy, simple and accessible.

Any suggestions as to how to take this further or interest from others is always welcome...use my gitter link above.
